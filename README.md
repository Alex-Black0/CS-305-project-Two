Portfolio Artifact: Artemis Financial – Practices for Secure Software Report
Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements.
Artemis Financial is a consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for clients, covering savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. They sought to modernize their operations by securing their public web application. Specifically, they needed secure communications (HTTPS) and a checksum verification mechanism to protect client data during transmission.

What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
I successfully identified the need for HTTPS encryption and checksum generation to secure client communications and prevent data tampering. Secure coding is vital because it protects sensitive data, maintains client trust, and prevents cyberattacks. Security is foundational to a company's stability, reputation, and legal compliance.

Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
Managing the SSL/TLS certificate generation and configuration in the Spring Boot environment was the most challenging aspect. Ensuring the HTTPS protocol worked correctly with a custom keystore required attention to detail. Running the secondary dependency-check analysis was very helpful in verifying that no additional vulnerabilities were introduced.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
I increased security by generating and installing a self-signed SSL certificate, enforcing HTTPS, and implementing SHA-256 hashing for checksum verification. In the future, I would continue to use tools like OWASP Dependency-Check, static code analyzers like SonarQube, and follow threat modeling methodologies to assess vulnerabilities and prioritize mitigation.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
After refactoring, I tested the REST endpoint (/hash) to ensure it worked over HTTPS and returned the correct checksum values. I also ran the OWASP Dependency-Check Maven plug-in to scan the codebase and verified that no new vulnerabilities were introduced.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Java Keytool for certificate management

Spring Boot best practices for HTTPS configuration

OWASP Dependency-Check Maven plug-in for static security testing

Java's MessageDigest class for secure hashing These practices and tools will be valuable in future software development and cybersecurity-focused roles.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
I would present the refactored Spring Boot server that uses HTTPS and implements secure checksum verification. I would also show the vulnerability report generated by the dependency-check tool to demonstrate that the application has been audited for known security vulnerabilities, proving my ability to develop secure software according to industry standards.
